=> # a hash rocket

#when you create a hash with strings you need a hash rocket
a = { "my_first_hash"} => "Hey man" }

#access the hash
#if you create a hash with a string then you have to access it with quotes

a.class => hash #a is a hash value

#a hash is a key value
#ex: if someone asks for a key value they are asking for a hash

#most of the time you should write hash using colons

#a hash of my name called 'name'
