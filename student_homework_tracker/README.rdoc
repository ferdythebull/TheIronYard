For Nick:

jQuery issues. 
  1. On pages such as /locations/:id
    - Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'options' of null
    - Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'attachEvent' of null 

  2. Often times the first tab's accordion will open completely, but the subsequent accordions will not open
