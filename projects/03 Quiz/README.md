This is a 10-question quiz created in ruby.
The user inputs letters for a multiple-choice quiz.
At the end, the total questions answered correctly, as well as the total questions answered incorrectly, are added up.

I tried to make the questions of the quiz funny. Give it a try and let me know what you think.
