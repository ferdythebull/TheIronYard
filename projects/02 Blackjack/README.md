== Day 2 at The Iron Yard We covered loops during the morning lecture and then coded a game of blackjack.

== Blackjack (Ruby)

-Set local variables for the player's cards and the dealer's cards and assigned them each an empty array -Set gammon as an instance variable with a boolean value of true for starting/ending of game -Defined random card with a range from 1-11 for dealing of cards -Defined check win to determine who wins by way of an if/elsif statement -Deal 2 cards to each player which are pushed to separate arrays -The first while loop is for the player. Within the outer while loop, an inner loop displays the players cards. Then there is an if/else statement to first check to see if the player was dealt two 11's which would be a bust and the game would end. If not a bust, the player is then given the option to either stay pat or to draw another card. -Next the dealer is shown his cards and unlike the player, the dealer is not provided with an option to stay of take another card. The dealer must take another card if less than 17 and stay if 17 or greater. -After both players have taken their turn, the card values are passed to the check win function to determine the winner.
