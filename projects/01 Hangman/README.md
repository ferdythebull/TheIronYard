This Hangman program is the first program I made in Ruby.
It's a fun little hangman game.
It calls a random word from a dictionary file, then outputs an underscore for however many letters the word contains.
As the player guesses letters correctly, the underscores of the corresponding letters are replaced by the letter.
As the player guesses letters incorrectly, the incorrect letter guesses go into the word bank below.

Have some fun and give it a whirl!
